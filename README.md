# Weather (Weather Forecast App)
Weather is an Android application developed using Kotlin and follows the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architecture. The project utilizes Hilt for dependency injection, Retrofit with coroutines for network requests, Shared Preferences for local data storage, Glide for image loading.

## The Goal of the Project
Developing projects using architecture, technologies and libraries that I learned during the course.

## Architecture
The application architecture is based on the MVVM pattern, which separates the data presentation logic (Views or UI) from the core business logic of the application.

## Libraries
**- Retrofit ->** A type-safe HTTP client for Android and the JVM. <br/>
**- Coroutines ->** Library support for Kotlin coroutines. <br/>
**- Glide ->** A fast and efficient open-source media management and image loading framework. <br/>
